Python Creations Explanations (For Presentation) 


A three-stage barrier system was implemented, allowing each barrier to visually transition from healthy → cracked → shattered as it takes damage. The stage value increments with every hit and determines which sprite is displayed.

Code Example:

self.images = [
    barrier_full_img,
    barrier_cracked_img,
    barrier_shattered_img
]

def take_damage(self):
    self.stage += 1
    if self.stage >= 3:
        return True



Player and enemy bullets were updated to interact with barriers before reaching the player or invaders. When a bullet collides with a barrier, the bullet is removed and the barrier progresses to the next damage stage.

Code Example:

for barrier in self.barriers[:]:
    if bullet.rect.colliderect(barrier.rect):
        self.player_bullets.remove(bullet)
        if barrier.take_damage():
            self.barriers.remove(barrier)
        break



A dedicated Barrier class was created to manage barrier appearance, position, hitbox, and damage progression. It stores all three stage images and updates the active sprite automatically when damage is taken.

Code Example:

class Barrier:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.stage = 0
        self.images = [
            barrier_full_img,
            barrier_cracked_img,
            barrier_shattered_img
        ]

    def draw(self, screen):
        screen.blit(self.images[self.stage], (self.x, self.y))
